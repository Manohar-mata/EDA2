Project 3: EDA On Penguin's Data

Hi Guys,

I am back with an exciting EDA project using pandas. I took the penguin's data set and did some data cleaning and preprocessing techniques. My last project is also about EDA but in this project, I did visualization for multiple attributes and drew some important features from the penguin's data. I hope with your support this journey to becoming a successful data analyst will come soon.... ðŸ˜Š
